Starting from day one with onsite support from District Manager Scott Adams to continued training support empowering my staff to grow. With this support and hard work, I was able to grow into 3 stores in less than 3 years with a plan for more on the horizon. If someone told me five years ago this is where I would be, I would have thought thatâ€™s impossible. Thanks for believing in me Tuffy!!</p>
